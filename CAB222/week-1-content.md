> I am not going through the history portion i do not care

## internet termniology and basics
>a decent chunk of this week is just terminology

|  Term  |  description  |
|-----|-----|
| LAN | Local Area Network, the lowest level of connection (think within the same network) |
| WAN | Wide Area Network, standard communication for carrying network traffic between locatoins |
| MAN | Metropolitan area networks, uses WAN tech to connect LANS within a geographic region (country, city etc) |
| Internetwork | a collection of LANS tied together by a device (eg router) |
| Internet | worldwide public internetwork, uses tcip/ip and http(s) |
| Intranet | a private internetwork only available to users connected to the network |
| Extranet | like an internetwork however it can be viewed by ean esxternal user |

## fundamentals of network communication
a computer netowrk requires at least 2 computers connected via some kind of transmission medium
- like an ethernet cable or via airwaves that are transmitted
- they then need to be connected to an interconnected device
  - router
  - switch
  - access points

### layers of the network communcation process
there are 4 steps to go through before reaching the network medium:
> sending machine
- user application
- network software
- network protocol
- network interface
> it is reversed for the receiving machine
after it goes through all of these layers it can go through the network medium and then through to the receiving machine.

## Network Architecture
the design of a communication network and is a framework that follows some specifications.

To quote the powerpoint
>> A networks's physical components and their functional organization and configuration, its operational principles and procedures, as well as data formats use.
