## Influences on the analysis process

- Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)
    - Are conditions not under the immediate control of the team
        - Influences the projet, portfolio or prgram
        - These conditions influence, constrain or provide direction on how analysis is conducted
- Organisational Process Assets (OPA)
    - The plans, processes, policies, procedures and knowledge bases specific to and used by the performing organisation
        - Grouped into 3 fiels
            - Business an procedures
                - Policy, procedures, guidelines, standards, risk management etc

# Week 2

## Business Value Assessment

BVA involves analysing current problems/oppurtunities and providinga viable solution, we need to ensure that these solutions align with the org's strategy and meets the needs of the business

When conducting a BVA, there are 3 primary steps:

### Understanding the situation

To begin, we first need to understand the What, How and Why of the situation. What is the problem, how did it occur, and why it was made. To help us arrive at these, we use the below process.

Good change to use customer journey maps, understanding the stakeholder is just as important as understanding the situation. Key details like age, occupation, location, background, What they want to achieve and more are things to gather and keep in mind.

We also need to understand how big of a problem this is problem/oppurtunity is.

Another portion of this is understanding the root cause as to how this situation has presented in the first place, issues such as the 5 whys, fishbone diagrams and analysing the existing process are suitable for this.

### The Six thinking hats

<img src="image-6.png" alt="Alt Text" style="width:75%; height:auto;">

- Explain each hat to the group
- Choose the problem that you would like to discuss
- Go through each of the hats
- Document key points of each hat
- Make a choice and take action

Once we have understood the overall situation, we now create a set of goals and objectives, to understand the size of the project and start an action plan.

### Find the Gaps

- Determine the area to be analysed based on the situation and root causes
- identify the internal and external factors on the situation
    - Pestle
    - Swot
    - Catwoe
- Analyse existing capabilities using historical data and business capability analysis
- Find the desired future state for these capabilities and performance indicators
- Analyse the fap to compare the current and desired states
    - Quantify the difference

- How is this delivered?
