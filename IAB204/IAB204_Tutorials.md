# Week 1

## Case study notes
QLDrail highlighted lack of drivers
    - Disruption to rail services
    - Hit to reputation
        - Unable to provide reliable and timeley service

Current challenges
    - Service cancellations
        - 20-30% are cancelled due to lack of drivers on a daily basis
    - Delay in service  
        - see previous point
    - Customer complaint
        - See first point

Key Issues
    - Timetable management
        - Regular timetable updates are required, which is made difficult with the constant cancellations
        - This data is calculated using historical driver hour data
    - Driver workload
        - Drivers are opting for better work life balance (wow!)
            - Throws a spanner into the works for timetable management
    - Recruitment challenges
        - Shortage of drivers and trainers
        - Training of drivers takes 12 months

- External Factors
    - Mining and other orgs that hire drivers of heavy vehicles are providing better compensation
        - Gov funding has been allocated to increase capacity/service offerings

- Corporate Policies
    - Drivers need to have a min of 3 years as a guard before becoming a driver
    - 12 hour breaks between shifts
        - No shift is to be longer than 10 hours
    - Less people taking trains

- Overarching trends
    - Increase sick/stress leave
    - Uptick in resignation
        - Could be due to external factors
    - Decline of overtime

## Task 1: Complete PESTLE analysis for the case study

| **Political**                         | **Economic**                                      | **Social**                       | **Tech**                                  | **Legal**                                                      | **Environmental**                                        |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Increased gov funding to increase cap | Other organisations have better compensation pack | Work/life balance more important | Antiquated scheduling system              | Drivers must wait 3 years before applying for driver positions | Environmentally conscious individuals can drive PT usage |
|                                       | Less income from reduced train passenger counts   | Low trust in service delivery    | Simulators can greatly assist in training |                                                                |                                                          |
|                                       |                                                   |                                  |                                           |                                                                |                                                          |

## Task 2: Create SWOT and then TOWS

### Swot

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** | **Oppurtunities** | **Threats** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Job Security | Unable to match compensation of other orgs | Automation | Other orgs can provide better compensation |
| Sole provider of rail service in QLD | Lower salary | Brisbane is the most congested city in Aus | Low trust in business - future patronage |
| Constantly upskilled staff (guard to driver etc) | high workload | Environmental issues are in the front of everyones mind |  |
| Highest capacity transport method |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |


### TOWS

| **SO** | **ST** | **WO** | **WT** |
|---|---|---|---|
| User government funding to improve workforce | Use government funding to improve compensation | Use gov funding to match compensation | Invest in better worker retnention strategy |
| Lean on the large capacity/lower overall emission as a branding option | No competition, consistent improvement will likely improve patronage | Utilize tech to improve scheduling |  |
