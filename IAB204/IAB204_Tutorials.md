# Week 1

## Case study notes
QLDrail highlighted lack of drivers
    - Disruption to rail services
    - Hit to reputation
        - Unable to provide reliable and timeley service

Current challenges
    - Service cancellations
        - 20-30% are cancelled due to lack of drivers on a daily basis
    - Delay in service  
        - see previous point
    - Customer complaint
        - See first point

Key Issues
    - Timetable management
        - Regular timetable updates are required, which is made difficult with the constant cancellations
        - This data is calculated using historical driver hour data
    - Driver workload
        - Drivers are opting for better work life balance (wow!)
            - Throws a spanner into the works for timetable management
    - Recruitment challenges
        - Shortage of drivers and trainers
        - Training of drivers takes 12 months

- External Factors
    - Mining and other orgs that hire drivers of heavy vehicles are providing better compensation
        - Gov funding has been allocated to increase capacity/service offerings

- Corporate Policies
    - Drivers need to have a min of 3 years as a guard before becoming a driver
    - 12 hour breaks between shifts
        - No shift is to be longer than 10 hours
    - Less people taking trains

- Overarching trends
    - Increase sick/stress leave
    - Uptick in resignation
        - Could be due to external factors
    - Decline of overtime

## Task 1: Complete PESTLE analysis for the case study

| **Political**                         | **Economic**                                      | **Social**                       | **Tech**                                  | **Legal**                                                      | **Environmental**                                        |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Increased gov funding to increase cap | Other organisations have better compensation pack | Work/life balance more important | Antiquated scheduling system              | Drivers must wait 3 years before applying for driver positions | Environmentally conscious individuals can drive PT usage |
|                                       | Less income from reduced train passenger counts   | Low trust in service delivery    | Simulators can greatly assist in training |                                                                |                                                          |
|                                       |                                                   |                                  |                                           |                                                                |                                                          |

## Task 2: Create SWOT and then TOWS

### Swot

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** | **Oppurtunities** | **Threats** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Job Security | Unable to match compensation of other orgs | Automation | Other orgs can provide better compensation |
| Sole provider of rail service in QLD | Lower salary | Brisbane is the most congested city in Aus | Low trust in business - future patronage |
| Constantly upskilled staff (guard to driver etc) | high workload | Environmental issues are in the front of everyones mind |  |
| Highest capacity transport method |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |


### TOWS

| **SO** | **ST** | **WO** | **WT** |
|---|---|---|---|
| User government funding to improve workforce | Use government funding to improve compensation | Use gov funding to match compensation | Invest in better worker retnention strategy |
| Lean on the large capacity/lower overall emission as a branding option | No competition, consistent improvement will likely improve patronage | Utilize tech to improve scheduling |  |

## Task 2

Perform a cost benefit analysis on the case in the worksheet,

Calculate the before vs after.

workers go from 12 to 14, how does that scale across all of the wokers?
How many gained working hours to I get from reduced absenteeism?
How much do I save on training costs by reducing turnover?

What are the benefits (gains)
What do i lose (cost)
How do they weigh up?

## Task 3

cost is 225000
y1 = 95000
y2 = 80000
y3 = 60000
y4 = 55000

### PBP

PBP = Initial Investment/Annual Return
PBP = 225000/95000
PBP = 2.368

### ROI

ROI = ((Total Net Return - Initial investment)/Initial Investment) * 100
ROI = ((290000 - 225000)/225000) * 100
ROI = (65000/225000) * 100
ROI = 0.288 * 100
ROI = 28%

### NPV
Find PV, then add together
Present Value = Future Value/(1+interest rate)^year number
PV = FV/(1+r)^1
PV = 95000/(1 + 0.12)^1
PV = 84821

PV = FV/(1+r)^2
PV = 80000(1.25)
PV = 64000

PV = FV/(1+r)^3
PV = 60000/1.4
PV = 42857

PV = FV/(1+r)^4
PV = 55000/1.568
PV = 35076

NPV = All added together
NPV = 226754

### IRR

I am skipping this its kind of a vibes thing
