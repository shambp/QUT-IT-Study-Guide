    - eg school kids, adults, business workers and retirees are different customer segments for a company that wants to sell Bicycles or a company that wants to sell food
 
 - Customer channels - are **HOW** your customers get access to your product or service
    - eg ecommerce, brick and morter stores, mobile apps

 - Product/service suppliers - organisations that supply products/services to organisations for use in internally running the business, supporting the business' creaiton and combing with other products/services for sale to the market
