### General business structures

### There are 4 things to keep in mind when looking at the general structure of a business:

 - Customer segments - specific groups of people in society that organisations support, or sell to with their products or services
    - eg school kids, adults, business workers and retirees are different customer segments for a company that wants to sell Bicycles or a company that wants to sell food

 - Customer channels - are **HOW** your customers get access to your product or service
    - eg ecommerce, brick and morter stores, mobile apps

 - Product/service suppliers - organisations that supply products/services to organisations for use in internally running the business, supporting the business' creaiton and combing with other products/services for sale to the market
    - eg manufacturers buying raw materials to fabricate into components and businesses buying those components to create their products

 - Supply Businesses - similair to product suppliers, but these organisations business generates business for another org
    - governments, sports assosciations.

  - Decision Support System (DSS)
    -  Used by middle management to generate reports and aid decision making
  
  - Executive Information System (EIS)
    - Used by execs to generate reports for strategic decision making

### What goes into an information system?
 
 - Hardware
    - Physical computer hardware
    - Input/output interfaced
    - Comms and storage devices
 
 - Software
    - Computer programs that enable the hardware to functions

 - Data
 
 - Polcies/processes
    - Governs the operation of the system

 - People
    - Users
    - Support

### Static vs adaptive systems

### The hierarchy of decision making

The higher someone is in an organistion, the more open ended, long term and infrequent a decision has to be made. We will be focusing on the highhest point of this.

#### What is strategic decision making?

A strategic decision is one that is long term, Can be based on what competitors are doing and often considers changes in technology

#### Why change?

Change is often forced upon a business due to changes in market, disruptive changes in tech, stakeholder influences, legal changes, unforseen circumstances and more.

If we don't change it can often lead to collapse in share price, loss in market share, mass resignation, loss of business and potentially business collapse

#### How do we avoid strategic failure?

To avoid failure in are strategies we should establish and follow a strategic plan. To create this we need to ask ourselves a few questions.

 - What is our current business situation?

 - What do we want the business to be?

 - Being sure to consider the businesses
   - Mission
      - The current state/purpose of the organisation
         - Why the organisation exists - What it does, who it does it for and how it accomplishes this

# Week 3

## What are Business Capabilities?

Describes **What** a business does, not how or why. Our capabilities can realte to other aspects of a business, as without our resources, value streams and information we cannot create capabilities.

### Examples

- Information security management
   - An IT department provides information security managemetn

- Product development
   - A marketing department develops and launches products

and so on.

## Capability Analysis

The purpose of capability analysis is to identify strengths, weaknesses, identify how to align with strategy and to plan our scope + prioritizing.

- What are out strongest and weakest capabilities?
- Which capabilities provide strategic differentiation?
- Where should we invest our resources
- Where can technology add more strategic value?
- Where can tech be used to lower cost?
- What business capability is needed?

We use a capability model that can define what an organization must be able to do to successfully execute its business model. It is an abstract and compact representation of the organizations. Is independant of the org's structure, processes etc.

## Mapping Business Capabilities

![alt text](image-10.png)

There are 2 levels of a capbility map. WE start with a very basic map.

And then move towards more customer facing capabilities.

## Capability Map levelling

- The bluieprint of capabilities for a given business
- Multiple levels (usually no more than 6)

![alt text](image-13.png)

- Each level provides deeper insight where appropriate level of analysis desired
- 1-3 is used for high level planning and business analysis
- level 3 onwards is used for IT analysis (used as input for requirements analysis)

## Value Streams and Capabilities

### What is a value stream?

- Is a visual representation of **one** of an organsiation's primary business activities
- The set of end-end activities that deliver value to external and internal takeholders
- outlines HOW value is created and delivered to stakeholders.

## Capability Assessment

There are 6 parts of a capability assessment:

- Identify strengths
- Understand weakness
- Identify limitations
- New capabilities
- Prioritize
- Aid planning

- Either:
   - Complete a high level assessment of all business capabilities and select those that may need attention
   - Only select those business capabilities that we deem as the most important
- Then create a standard unit of measure, which is usually a 3 to 5 point scale.
- Identify who is to be included in the assessment
- Perform the assessment

## Heat Mapping Capabilities

Is a colour coded capability model, which allows us to easily illustrate the current score of a capabilityS

## Capability-based analysis and planning

- Originally designed for military and government projects
- Now popular for IS system and strategy plannig
- A business capability is decribed by more than just the people perspective; it includes the process and physical perspective.
