## Exercise 1

### Case study:

> For years Starbucks has been successfully maintaining its dominant position in the coffee shop market despite the market
> becoming highly competitive with many players offering similar product and service offering of Starbucks. There has also been a
> rise in strong competition from fast food chains such as McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts that now offer premium coffee, which is
> threatening the market share of established players. In order to hold onto its competitive advantage and create new value
> proposition for its customers Starbucks has started to focus on the use of information technology, mobility and particularly social
> media. One such innovative value proposition by Starbucks is the Mobile Payments Application. Starbucks launched its mobile card
> app in 16 stores in early 2009 and after customer’s adoption increased, Starbucks expanded it countrywide in United States. The
> main feature of the App allows customers to generate a 2D barcode on their mobile device to be scanned and used as payment in
> stores. The App is an extension of Starbucks’ existing, tangible, pre-paid reward card for loyal customers. The App is marketed
> based on its benefits in saving time and making purchases more convenient for the customer. Starbucks refers to the App as “the
> fastest way to pay.” With this App customers can check their balance, reload card with any major credit card or PayPal, view
> transactions and conveniently track their Stars in the MSR (My Starbucks Rewards) program. The advantages for consumers are
> speed and one less card in their wallets. Using the app customers can also locate a mobile payment Starbucks near their location.

### Case study:
> Restaurant ABC was a small family-owned restaurant near to a ski resort in Tasmania. The restaurant was recently

> Shortly after taking over the restaurant, management of the ski resort held a day-long meeting with all the employees
> of the restaurant to discuss the future of the ski resort and the new strategic plans for it. At the end of this meeting,
> management and employees agreed that they need to improve customers’ satisfaction and improve weekly sales.
> average time to take an order and the average time to prepare an order were too long. They agreed that they should
> improve them and increase number of menu items. The managers realised that they may need to implement a new
> restaurant operating system to be able to achieve those objectives. Besides a new system, managers also decided to
> improve their kitchen staffs’ cooking skills and the hospitality skills of dining room staffs by sending those staffs to a
> basic cooking course and a basic hospitality course.
