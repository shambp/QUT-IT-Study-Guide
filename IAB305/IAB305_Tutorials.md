## Exercise 1

### Case study:

> For years Starbucks has been successfully maintaining its dominant position in the coffee shop market despite the market
> becoming highly competitive with many players offering similar product and service offering of Starbucks. There has also been a
> rise in strong competition from fast food chains such as McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts that now offer premium coffee, which is
> threatening the market share of established players. In order to hold onto its competitive advantage and create new value
> proposition for its customers Starbucks has started to focus on the use of information technology, mobility and particularly social
> media. One such innovative value proposition by Starbucks is the Mobile Payments Application. Starbucks launched its mobile card
> app in 16 stores in early 2009 and after customer’s adoption increased, Starbucks expanded it countrywide in United States. The
> main feature of the App allows customers to generate a 2D barcode on their mobile device to be scanned and used as payment in
> stores. The App is an extension of Starbucks’ existing, tangible, pre-paid reward card for loyal customers. The App is marketed
> based on its benefits in saving time and making purchases more convenient for the customer. Starbucks refers to the App as “the
> fastest way to pay.” With this App customers can check their balance, reload card with any major credit card or PayPal, view
> transactions and conveniently track their Stars in the MSR (My Starbucks Rewards) program. The advantages for consumers are
> speed and one less card in their wallets. Using the app customers can also locate a mobile payment Starbucks near their location.


#### Question: List the data types stored in the information system used by Starbucks and explain what information the system provides.

The data types that are stores within this informaiton system are as follows:


- Rewards card detail
    - Rewards card number
    - Current amount of points

- Customer details
    - Name
    - Date of birth?
    - Customer number (identifying customers by name would be archaic)
        - Allows us to link purchases up to a customer, giving us options to 

- Payment information
    - Card number
    - Expiry
    - Security code

- Store details
    - Store location
    - If store is participating in mobile payment

## Exercise 2


### Case study:
> Restaurant ABC was a small family-owned restaurant near to a ski resort in Tasmania. The restaurant was recently
> acquired to be a part of the ski resort. The new owners would like to make major improvement in the restaurant. The
> manager of the ski resort, while hardworking and enthusiastic, has very little experience in the restaurant business.
> Shortly after taking over the restaurant, management of the ski resort held a day-long meeting with all the employees
> of the restaurant to discuss the future of the ski resort and the new strategic plans for it. At the end of this meeting,
> management and employees agreed that they need to improve customers’ satisfaction and improve weekly sales.
> average time to take an order and the average time to prepare an order were too long. They agreed that they should
> improve them and increase number of menu items. The managers realised that they may need to implement a new
> restaurant operating system to be able to achieve those objectives. Besides a new system, managers also decided to
> improve their kitchen staffs’ cooking skills and the hospitality skills of dining room staffs by sending those staffs to a
> basic cooking course and a basic hospitality course.
