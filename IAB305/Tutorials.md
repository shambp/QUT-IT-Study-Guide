Case Study:
Restaurant ABC was a small family-owned restaurant near to a ski resort in Tasmania. The restaurant was recently
acquired to be a part of the ski resort. The new owners would like to make major improvement in the restaurant. The
manager of the ski resort, while hardworking and enthusiastic, has very little experience in the restaurant business.
Shortly after taking over the restaurant, management of the ski resort held a day-long meeting with all the employees
of the restaurant to discuss the future of the ski resort and the new strategic plans for it. At the end of this meeting,
management and employees agreed that they need to improve customers’ satisfaction and improve weekly sales.
Previously, all orders, payments, reservations etc. were manually done and the menu was very limited. Therefore, the
average time to take an order and the average time to prepare an order were too long. They agreed that they should
improve them and increase number of menu items. The managers realised that they may need to implement a new
restaurant operating system to be able to achieve those objectives. Besides a new system, managers also decided to
improve their kitchen staffs’ cooking skills and the hospitality skills of dining room staffs by sending those staffs to a
basic cooking course and a basic hospitality course.```
