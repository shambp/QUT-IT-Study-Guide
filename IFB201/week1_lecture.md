## Summary
Learning about what an enterprise system is, covering the unit schedule and a few other things

## What are Enterprises and Enterprise Systems?
### Enterprises
An enterprise is a grou pof people with a common goal and specific resources that help them achieve said goal, this can be money, people etc). 

###Enterprise Systems
An information system that improves the functions of a business process, which rises the next question of...

### What is a Business Process?
Is the means through which an organisation carries out its work and delivers its products/services to a customer. You input resources and through the business process create an output.

## Functional Areas of Operations
In an enterprise you have departments, with each department having their own goal. For example the HR department wants to manage their employees whereas the software development team wants to develop software.

### IT Silos
IT silos is the concept that each functional area of operations ahs their own app and database, that is later linked together with the other areas of operations

#### Why This is Bad
IT Silos are inefficient, expensive and inaccurate, ahving to have multiple apps and databases is a recipe for messy data and high server costs. There is little flexibility in this method and means that each system needs to be audited independently.

### Enterprise Systems Integration
Unlike silos, an integrated enterprise system is homogoneous. Choosing to rather centralise as much as humanly possible to prevent the weaknesses outlined above.

### Business Processes vs Functional Areas
Functional areas are a part of the busuiness processes, an example of this is:

`input` customer purchasing something < `Functional area` Marketing and sales < `process` Sales order < `Output` Order is generated

## Types of Enterprise Systems and their Functions

* Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR)
  *   CPFR is a set of data driven business processes designed to improve forecasting and the ability to predict and coordinate with supply chain partners
