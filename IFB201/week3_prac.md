### Activity 1
Today we start off with using leads to track potential customers.

A lead is a potential customer (lol). There are several ways to find leads. Many of them are referred to you by a happy customers. You can also find leads when customers contact you, stop by at a conference, exchange information with another company etc. Not all companies use leads.

Adding a lead to salesforce it as easy as clicking the Lead tab < new < add the records

Creating a lead indicates that YOU believe that they have a use for and interest in the product you are selling. With the sale having a definite possibility. The criteria used goes by a company by company basis.

Leads can turn into a business accuont, a contact or an oppurtunity.

To convert a lead into something else we can:
open the accounts tab < click on the company that your lead works for < contacts < create the contact | if the contact already exists select existing contact < in oppurtunity do the things there < and click convert :)
