# Bytes, Nibbles and Bits
Computers work on 1's and 0's, we arrange them in an array of 8 bits or a Byte

```
00000000 < this is a byte
0000 < within a bit are 2 nibbles
0 < and within the nibble are 4 bits
*fyi the terminology still applies if its a 1, using all zeros is just easier
```

the reason we do this, is because computers count in base 2, as compared to how we as humans count (base 10)

```Humans count like 0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9```
